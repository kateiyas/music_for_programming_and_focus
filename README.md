# Music for focus and programming

Collection of audio resources for keeping up focus in too noisy or too silent environments. 

* [mynoise.net](http://www.mynoise.net) (collection of excellent noise generators, try this one for Blade Runner: https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/november2019SoundscapeGenerator.php)
* [musicforprogramming.net](http://musicforprogramming.net) (collection of ~1h mixed tracks available for download)

### Lo-Fi music

Very chill tracks that got popular for focus, studying during the 2010s. 

(TODO: add collection)

### Video game OSTs

Most video game scores are written for keeping up tense focus without becoming too emotional, and can loop endlessly. 

* Deus Ex: Human Revolution
* Diablo
* Diablo II
* Ecco
* Ecco 2: The Tides of Time
* Riven
* Myst

(TODO: add collection)

What doesn't work: 
* most music with vocals (except for those that aren't easy to parse, like gutterals)
* classical music (far too captivating / emotional)
* movie scores (far too emotional)
* most tracks labeled "ambient" (too esoteric)
